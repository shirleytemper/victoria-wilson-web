                <p>Victoria is a University of Utah alumnus with dual degrees in Cognitive Psychology and in Health, Society & Policy. As an undergraduate, she was involved in scientific research in both specialties. Her work in memory cognition and visual search received a research award and full funding. Additionally, she spent time in Ghana examining the incidence of chronic pain in rural populations. This work highlighted the importance of developing policy that is evidence-based to be effective in a public health concern. Desiring to find a better way to bring scientific advancements to the public sphere, she pursued a career in health policy. Specializing in pain management, she worked for several years coordinating policy for the largest healthcare organization in the Mountain West. During this time, Victoria realized first-hand the difficulty in translating scientific advancements into public policy. Often, a fissure exists between the evidence and the implementation of solutions, which can negatively impact a diverse array of people. Her passion for using data-driven policy to create equitable advancements in healthcare led her to pursue an MA in Bioethics & Science Policy from Duke University. <a href="https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/learn/ma/the-student-experience/profiles-of-ma-students/">View Complete Profile</a></p>
